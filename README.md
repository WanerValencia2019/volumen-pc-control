# Dynamic Volume Control

Dynamic Volume Control is a Python script designed to automatically adjust your computer's volume level based on the real-time analysis of the audio output. This project aims to enhance the listening experience by ensuring the volume stays within a comfortable range, especially useful during movie watching where volume levels can vary dramatically.

## Features

- Real-time audio analysis to detect current volume levels.
- Automatic volume adjustment to maintain a comfortable listening experience.
- Customizable volume thresholds for high and low volume adjustments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyAudio
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code.
   - git clone https://github.com/WanerValencia2019/DynamicVolumeControl.git
3. Install the required Python packages.
   - pip install pyaudio numpy
4. Run the script.
    - python3 dynamic_volume_control.py


## Usage

After installation, execute the script. It will continuously monitor the system's audio output. When the volume exceeds predefined thresholds, it automatically adjusts the volume to a predefined level, ensuring a consistent audio experience.
